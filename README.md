# DailyEat.ai

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This proyect has as a goal create a daily menu generator based on the user budget and preferences. The user will be able to enter his daily or monthly budget and discard the ingredients that he doesn't like or can't eat and the system will return a list with daily menus with recipes and shopping list.

## Background

The idea behind this project is that people can find recipes that fit their budget and tastes. Many times the people don't know what to cook, or don't have the budget to eat varied and end up eating always the same. This project seeks to solve that problem.

This problem is very common in people who live alone, who don't have much time to cook or who don't know how to cook. It is also very common in people who have a limited budget and don't know how to spend it efficiently.

My personal motivation to do this project is to help people who don't have enough time to think about what to eat or who don't have enough resources to eat varied and healthy.

## How is it used?

In the application, users will enter their daily or monthly budget as the first parameter, then they will choose the ingredients they don't like or can't eat and with that data the application will give them a list of daily menus with their recipes and a shopping list.

This project could be used by anyone who wants to improve their daily diet and doesn't have much time to think about what to cook or who doesn't have a large budget to eat varied.

## Data sources and AI methods

The recipes will be obtained from the [Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) API which contains a large database of recipes from all over the world. The API allows queries by ingredients by type of diet, by intolerances, by type of food, etc.

The ingredient prices will be obtained from local supermarkets or markets.

## Challenges

This project doesn't solve the problem of lack of time to cook nor the problem of the lack of economic resources to buy the ingredients. The application will be less accurate the lower the user's budget is but it seeks to find a balance.

## What next?

The more users there are using the application, the more data can be obtained and the more accurate the application will be. We could also add the option for the user to add their own recipes and thus help other users to find new recipes.
